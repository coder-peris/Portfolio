## Tech Stack & Tools Used

-   **Framework:** Next.js (React-based)
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for light/dark mode support
-   **TypeScript:** For static type checking and safer code
-   **Icons:** React Icons (FaGithub, FaLinkedin, IoMoonOutline, etc.)
-   **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image component
-   **State & Form Handling:** React hooks (`useState`), client-side form validation
-   **Theme Management:** `next-themes` for dark/light mode toggling
-   **Notifications:** Sonner for toast notifications
-   **Animations:** CSS transitions and hover effects via Tailwind CSS
-   **Deployment:** Vercel

## How It Works

-   Theme state persists system preference and user choice using `next-themes`
